# BloGO!
> This is a fork and a WIP!
---

The source code here allows for the creation of a markdown based blog built in Go. The program includes code to support comments.

# A fork?
This project is a fork of [gomarkdownblog](https://github.com/adamprocter/gomarkdownblog) by adamprocter.
I am working on adding features at the moment to make their rather old repo more user friendly.
